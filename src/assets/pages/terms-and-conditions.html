            The rolling out of the eLocker platform is being done in alignment with the Government of Sri Lanka’s Digital Government Strategy 2020-2024. This goes hand-in-hand with the SLUDI initiative, which provides all Sri Lankans with a biometric-enabled unique Digital Identity. To aid this vision, the eLocker platform has used the open-source “Sunbird-RC” digital credentialing platform, as the core technology foundation.
            <br>
            ICTA has taken steps to launch the eLocker platform, in synchronisation with the Pilot launch of SLUDI in the country. As part of the 1st release of the eLocker, the citizens will have the ability to fetch and maintain their SLUDI identity and COVID-Vaccination certificates as well as scanned copies of other Government documents, in their eLocker Wallet. Supporting other forms of Government and Private sector digital credentials in the eLocker, will be rolled out in due course. The eLocker platform will also provide various Government departments an ability to issue tamper-proof, digitally signed documents for various transactions, in the future.
